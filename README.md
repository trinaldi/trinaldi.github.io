Small portfolio I created *and* hosted around 2015-2016 in my notebook and even a Raspberry Pi.

It was a great experience to learn about [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and all the DevOps tools available to a common user. Also, this way I could create different sites using different stacks (Flask, Django (Python); Rails (Ruby), for example).
I had to deal with ISPs blocking port 80, all ports in some cases. At the time Windows 8 was new and there was some workaround to
make `media-queries` work with it.

As of 2020, this is a whole new concept.

## Rationale

Create a simple and yet useable website for my contact.

## Next steps

~~- Create a blog to include my thoughts. (Brace yourselves.) ~~
