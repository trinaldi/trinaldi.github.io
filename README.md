Small portfolio I created *and* hosted around 2015-2016 in my notebook and even a Raspberry Pi.

It was a great experience to learn about Apache, NGINX and all the DevOps tools available to a common user.  
I had to deal with ISPs blocking port 80, all ports in some cases. At the time Windows 8 was new and there was some workaround to
make `media-queries` work with it.

## Rationale

I know, it's just a simple HTML page with the default Bootstrap CSS, but that was not the point. As mentioned above, the point was
learning about hosting. Mission accomplished (not that I know it all).

## Next steps

- Create a blog to inclusde my thoughts.
