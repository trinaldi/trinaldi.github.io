Small portfolio I created *and* hosted around 2015-2016 in my notebook and even a Raspberry Pi.

It was a great experience to learn about [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/), [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) and all the DevOps tools available to a common user. Also, this way I could create different sites using different stacks (Flask, Django (Python); Rails (Ruby), for example).  
I had to deal with ISPs blocking port 80, all ports in some cases. At the time Windows 8 was new and there was some workaround to
make `media-queries` work with it.

## Rationale

I know, it's just a simple HTML page with the default [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS, but that was not the point. As mentioned above, the point was
learning about hosting. Mission accomplished (not that I know it all).

## Next steps

- Create a blog to include my thoughts. (Brace yourselves.)
